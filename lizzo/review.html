<h2> About Lizzo </h2>

<p id = "box"> Melissa Jefferson, famously known as <i> Lizzo </i> is an
American singer, rapper, and actress. Lizzo is Detroit native but, she was raised in Houston, Texas.
Before signing with <i> Atlantic Records </i> she released two studio albums in the year 2013 and 2015. This year her newest album <i> <b> "Cuz I Love You" </i> </b> blew up putting her number six on the Billboard 200 chard! Her top songs are <u>"Truth Hurts"</u> and <u> "Juice" </u>  </p>

<h2> My personal opinion </h2>
<p id="box2"> I first discovered Lizzo on instragram when I saw her playing the flute. I thought it was
    so cool because I never seeen anyone in the Hip Hop industry play a flute especially as a solo.
